# ======================================== FOR LOOPS =============================================

# for loops iterate over a collection of items or through a range of numbers

# #syntax:
# for item in iterable_object:
#     #do something with item!

# #for loop with string
# for char in "hello":
#     print(char)

# for letter in "coffee":
#     print(letter*10)

# # a RANGE is a way of quickly generating numbers (within a specific range)
# for number in range(1,8):
#     print(number)
#     print(number*number)

# ranges in depth
# python ranges come in multiple forms:
range(7) #gives you integers from 0-6
range(1,8) #gives you integers 1-7
# if there is a third number, it's known as the step or interval
range(1,10,2) #gives you odds from 1-10
range(7, 0, -1) #gives you integers from 7 to 1

r = range(10)
list(r)
# print(list(r))

nums = range(1,10,2)
# print(list(nums))

# add up all the ODD numbers between 10 and 20
x = 0
for n in range(10, 21):  # remember range is exclusive, so we have to go up to 21
    if n % 2 != 0:
        x += n

# OR
for i in range(11, 21, 2):
        x += i

# # repeater exercise!
# times = input('how many times do i have to tell you!? ')
# times = int(times)

# for time in range(times):
#     # print('CLEAN UP YOUR ROOM!')
#     print(f"time {time}: CLEAN UP YOUR ROOM!")

# unlucky number exercise
# for 4 and 13, print 'x is unlucky', for even nums, print 'x is even', for odds, print 'x is odd'.
# for i in range(1, 21):
#     if i == 4 or i == 13:
#         print(f"{i} is unlucky!")
#     elif i % 2 == 0:
#         print(f"{i} is even!")
#     elif i % 2 != 0:
#         print(f"{i} is odd!")


# ======================================== WHILE LOOPS ===========================================
# there's a lot of things you can do with  a while loop that you can't do with a for loop!
# while loops execute while a certain condition is truthy and they end with they become falsy!
# they require more set up because they often rely on existing variable and a means to ensure
# the termination conditions WILL stop the loop, or else the loop will continue forever!

# im_tired = True

# msg = input('what is the secret password? ')
# while msg != 'bananas':
#     print('wrong password, try again! ')
#     msg = input('what is the secret password? ')
# print('correct!')
