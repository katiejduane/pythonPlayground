# integer = 4 (pos or neg)
# float = 4.2 (or however many decimal points) (also called 'floating points')(pos or neg)
print(type(9))
print(type(9.609))

print(1 + 1.0)
# if any part of the expression is a float, the result is a float

# OPERATORS:
# + addition
# - subtraction
# * multiplication
# / division
# ** exponation
# % modulo
# // integer division

print(1/2)
print(1/3)

# PEMDAS applies to python!

# WEIRDER OPERATORS!
# Exponation: 
print(2 ** 3)

# Modulo (the 'remainder' operator)
print(4%2) #remainder 0
print(10% 3) #remainder 1
print(111 % 7)

# Integer Division:
print(10//3)
# it does the division but gives only an INT, not a float, even if a float is the "correct" answer
